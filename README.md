# personal_site

## Description of my personal site below
_I made a functional website with four different pages (Home, About, Portfolio, Contact). Those include links that bring you to the specified page and include personalized content and formatted text and images. I also used CSS styling which was included via an external file and a "Hello World" external Javascript file which are now compressed and submitted via this GitHub repository. Some other things I added were a contact page that has a form asking for the users first name, last name, a message and their email followed by a submit button. On the contact page, I scripted a 'app.js' file that prints "Submitted" in the console as well._
